    "## Exercise 1: Wood management in Switzerland\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise investigates the use of wood for construction and energy purposes. Two types of wood are harvested in Switzerland: **logs for lumber** and **wood for energy**. The first one is **used in buildings** whereas the second is for **space heating**. Roundwood logs are transported to **sawmills** in order to be transformed into construction materials. \n",
    "The **wastes generated by sawmills are recycled**, as well as the secondary wood materials collected in buildings during **demolition**. The recycling process produces **additional wood for heating**. The system boundaries do not include the **stock accumulating in buildings**, therefore it will be considered **as an output**. In 2010, a total of 5’500’000 m3 of wood were harvested and two scenarios should be considered, (a) 30% of the harvest is used for heating, (b) 70% of the harvest is used for heating. In both scenarios, the remaining fraction of wood harvested is used for construction materials.\n",

    "An agricultural enterprise involves the processes of **cultivation**, which includes the vegetation itself, **livestock production**, and **soil**. To feed the livestock, the farmer uses both **imported** and internal fodder (1 and 15 gCd/y respectively). The products from the livestock (milk and meat) have a cadmium content of 2 gCd/y and are **sold on the local market**. The manure is used to fertilise the crops. The cadmium **fallout from the atmosphere** to the crops represents 30 gCd/y. The farmer also uses **artificial fertiliser** with a cadmium content of 5 gCd/y for the cultivation. We assume that all these cadmium inputs are assimilated by the vegetal cover and the concentration in the harvest is 17 gCd/y. Part of it is sold to the local market (2 gCd/y) and the rest is used as fodder. All the crop by–products decompose on the land to feed the soil. There is some **erosion and run–off happening**, which takes out 2 gCd/y from the soil into the water.\n",
